/* portgame.h: UW2's side of Exhume's runtime (docs/PORT.md, "The runtime"). The runtime's
   port.h, compat.h, plat.h and its sound and system C include it, ahead of their own defaults;
   compat.h brings it into the game's C too, so it declares only the port's names.

   The program's name in its messages, and the game's main it runs; DGROUP's paragraph in
   UW2.EXE, which the pseudo-registers _DS and _SS start with, and where Borland's _ctype table
   sits in DGROUP; the termination chain exit runs, which seg021's init hooked; the black box;
   the window; how the game's folder is found and what the settings file is called; the sound
   library's environment variables; and the far data blocks of UW2.EXE that no source defines
   yet (mem/fardata.c), whose initial bytes are read from the user's own UW2.EXE at start-up,
   never shipped. The load segment and the far heap are the runtime's defaults. */
