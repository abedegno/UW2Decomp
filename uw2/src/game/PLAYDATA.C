   save_player_data and read_player_data (called from INVSAVE.C, inside a save or a
   restore) write and read struct Player as the PLAYER.DAT image: one key byte, name[0]
   xor 0xAA, then the 0x37D-byte record xor-encoded with that key (xorwrite, xorread).
   Before writing, the values that live elsewhere while playing (attributes, HP, the

   record; after reading they are copied back out.
   FixPlayerEquips is called whenever equipment, spells or light change (14 callers): it
   recomputes armour by hit location, defence, the weapon's animation, the brightest
   carried light, the effects of active spells and of enchanted worn items
   (player_affected_by), stealth (plyNotice), the light level and the mushroom effect.
   load_dl reads the level's entry in DATA\DL.DAT, the minimum light of each level.
