/* The player's timed updates: active spells running down, light sources burning out,
   poison, hunger, drunkenness, drowning, and the hourly schedule. The whole of DOS
   overlay ovr135, in original order. Function and global names are the originals from
   the FM Towns symbol table.

   The clock: INTERACT.C calls duration_check once every 20 steps of game_clock >> 8.
   plyregen[1] counts the calls, and the work is spread over that count:
     every call     active spells lose a step, lights burn, mushrooms wear off,
                    regeneration, drowning, Killorn's countdown, the sleep counter;
     every 3rd      poison damage, and a mana regeneration roll on the mana skill;
     every 30th     hunger, sobering up, a 1 in 4 chance of wandering monsters, the
                    critters' yearly_checkup, fatigue and two neighbouring bytes counted
                    up, and an HP regeneration roll on strength (inferred: attr[0]);
     every 60th     the time of day, X clock 0, moves on one of its 72 steps and the
                    schedules in SCD.ARK block 0 are run up to the new time.
   Entry points: duration_check (INTERACT.C), set_curmagic (the spells, to start an active
   spell), DegradeLights (also called with a larger amount when time passes quickly,
   probably by sleeping), sink_sink_sink, dispel_spell.
   Data: none of its own; plyregen and the light tables are elsewhere.
   Name: descriptive (the player's timed updates: duration_check, DegradeLights). */
