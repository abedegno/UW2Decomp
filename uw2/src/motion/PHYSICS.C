/* The player's physics: the terrain the player stands in, the simple step-and-turn
   movement, the per-tick motion setup from the input and the floor, applying the result
   to the player object, and moving the player between tiles. The whole of DOS resident
   segment seg008_1B09, in original order. Function and global names are the originals
   from the FM Towns symbol table where it has them.

   The player's physics record is PN (motion.h, owned by MOTION.C) with the handler PT,
   whose special function is player_sqhandler. Each tick PLAYMOVE.C's move_player calls
   set_player_phys_params (input, ice and currents into PN), MOTION.C's do_physics, and
   phys_affect_player (PN back into the player object, ThePlayer, and fall damage).
   simple_fizix is the other way to move: a fixed step or a 45 degree turn, for the
   step keys and the arrows over the view.

   The movement state (newFPS's state, player->fps): 0 on foot, 1 swimming, 2 on lava,
   3 on ice, and in the air 4 levitating, 5 flying, 6 slow falling. It sets
   player->motion_state's low bits (1 swimming, 2 lava, 4 ice, 8 levitating or flying;
   the high bits 0x20, 0x40 and 0x80 are PLAYMOVE.C's screen shakes) and the speeds
   pFPS, scaled from Run_FPS, Side_FPS and Back_FPS. motionbits holds the motion spells,
   bit minor - 1 for spell class 1 (game/PLAYDATA.C), which the Guide lists as 1 Leap,
   2 Slow Fall, 3 Levitate, 4 Water Walk, 5 Fly, 6 Bouncing: so 1 leap (lower gravity
   when jumping), 2 slow fall, 4 levitate, 8 water walk (no swimming), 0x10 fly, 0x20
   bouncing (MOTION.C's do_zbounce).

   GrSq is the player's tile as an index into mapdata; change_GrSq moves the player
   object between tile lists, runs pressure plates and updates the light.

   name: inferred (map/filenames.tsv: the player's physics, simple_fizix and fizix_update;
   the job of System Shock's PHYSICS.C, though that file drives the EDMS physics library
   and shares no code with this one). */
