/* Sound and music: MIDI effects and instruments played on spare channels of the XMIDI
   driver, the music sequences and their timbres, the digitised speech of the cutscenes
   streamed from SOUND\nn.VOC through EMS, and the sound settings. The whole of UW1's DOS
   resident segment seg014_1DC5 (UW2's seg016), in original order. Seeded from UW2Decomp's
   src/sound/SOUND.C.

   Start-up (UWEDIT.C): seg014_1DC5_1D0D reads the music and speech card numbers from
   UW.CFG; init_sounds loads the music driver named for the card (music_drivers: card 1
   PCSPKR.ADV, 2 ADLIB, 3 SBFM, 4 SBPFM, 5 PASFM, 6 MT32MPU) and, when there is a speech
   card, init_speech loads its digital driver (speech_drivers: 1 SBDIG.ADV, 2 SBPDIG,
   3 PASDIG); then SOUND\SOUNDS.DAT into `effects` with the 16 Hz effects timer
   (init_fx), and the timbre library SOUND\UW.<suffix>. init_timers starts the game
   clock: an AIL timer at 256 Hz whose callback, cllbck_tst, increments *Time.

   Effects: play_effect and its variants take an entry of SOUNDS.DAT (patch, note,
   volume, length) and play it as a MIDI note on one of four channels locked from the
   music driver (fx_play), panned and faded by the source's position. UW1 has no
   digitised effects.

   Music: the theme playing (curmusic) and the one wanted next (newmusic) are numbers
   whose two octal digits name SOUND\UWnn.XMI on the MT-32 and SOUND\AWnn.XMI otherwise.
   change_music_maybe, from the main loop, switches themes: 2 to 4 are the walking themes
   (chosen at random), 5 to 7 the combat themes, 8 plays while the weapon is drawn.

   Speech: play_speech(n) reads SOUND\nn.VOC into six 16 KB EMS pages (three critter
   page pairs lent by ovr113_2A2) and plays it through two 4 KB buffers that
   update_speech refills.

   UW1 against UW2: no digitised effects (no digi_fx_timer, init_digi_fx, load_digi_fx,
   punt_all_digi_fx, free_dfx_ems, load_dfx_page, digi_fx_play, update_digi_playback,
   stop_digi_file, kill_all_digi_effects, play_effect_on_mobile_src), so sound_move is
   part of play_effect; no punt_sound_stuff (init_sounds clears the flags itself), no
   free_s_mem, fx_available or music_available; four MIDI effect slots, not three; the
   driver file names come from tables, not from the card number; no walking_music table
   (set_random_walking_music is seg014_1DC5_15C5, a random theme 2 to 4); new: the cup
   of wonder's tune (play_cup_tune) and the speech player (init_voc, play_speech,
   update_speech, speech_over, stop_speech; UW2 keeps only empty or unused remains of
   them). The flags are plain (signed) char.

   name: function names are UW2's (the FM Towns symbol table) where the routine is the
   same, and symbols.tsv's where other files already call them (seg014_1DC5_C7C is UW2's
   kill_all_effects, seg014_1DC5_15C5 its set_random_walking_music, seg014_1DC5_1D0D its
   seg016_1E73_2FCB). The new ones are descriptive. Statics are named for their place in
   _BSS (see below). */
