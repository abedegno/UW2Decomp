/* The mouse: the cursor, its save-under, the input queue, the mouse regions that pick the
   cursor shape, keyboard warping of the pointer, and the keyboard reader the input loop
   shares with it. The whole of UW1's DOS resident segment seg013_1CC9, in original order.
   UW1 has no symbol-bearing build; the names are UW2's (the FM Towns symbol table; UW2's
   MOUSE.C, seg015_1D7C), the code being the same routines.

   Coordinates: x runs 0 to 319 left to right and y 0 to 199 from the bottom of the screen
   up (moveMouse subtracts the driver's downward motion; the keypad 8 key warps to y 199).

   Main entry points: get_input (through mouse_get_input and mouse_get_input_sp) is the
   one place every input loop reads an event: it alternates between the mouse and the
   keyboard and returns 1 to 3 for the buttons held (1 left, 2 right), a key code
   (do_keyboard_input, with KEY_CTRL, KEY_ALT and KEY_SHIFT added, ui.h) or -1. moveMouse
   polls the driver and moves and redraws the cursor; it is called from every wait loop.
   mouse_release and mouse_dragged wait for the buttons to come up. defineMouseRegion and
   force_mouse_cursor choose the cursor picture; keyboard_mouse moves the pointer from the
   keypad.

   Data owned: the pointer position and cursor picture, the save-under bookkeeping, a
   one-deep queue of a button press seen while the game was busy (MousQUp records it from
   the 3D renderer and do_mouse_input replays it), up to 20 cursor regions, the
   force_mouse_cursor stack (three deep), the keyboard warp state and the 3D view's
   rectangle (m3dx ... m3dt) used to draw the cursor into the frame buffer.

   UW1's differences, marked "UW1:" where they are not obvious: no joystick and no
   left-handed button swap (so no joymovecur, fauxright or mouse_hand); when the cursor
   straddles the 3D view's edge outside screen mode 1 (inplist->mode), mous_3d_hide hides
   it on the whole screen and mous_3d_show (empty in UW2) shows it again, and
   MousReSave3d saves the background into the frame buffer in mode 1 only; Tab and
   Shift+Tab move the pointer between three places on the row y 130 (x 20, 130 and 280).

   Name: inferred (the mouse: init_mouse, mouse_getxy, mouse_putxy, mouse_constrain;
   System Shock's input library MOUSE.C has the same calls, mouse_init, mouse_get_xy,
   mouse_put_xy, mouse_constrain_xy). */
