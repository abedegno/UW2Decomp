/* Damage to objects that are not critters: resistances, wear on doors and containers,
   and what an object leaves behind when it breaks. The whole of DOS resident segment
   seg023, in original order. Seeded from UW2Decomp's src/combat/DAMAGE.C (UW2's
   seg025_26A1). Function names are UW2's (the FM Towns originals), the routines being the
   same; UW1 has no symbols of its own.

   What it does in the game: every source of damage (melee in COMBAT.C, spells in
   SPELLS.C, falls and collisions in the motion code, traps) calls damage_item. It applies
   the item's resistances from ComObjData (check_res), hands critters to damage_critter,
   and for anything else takes the damage off the object's hit points or quality
   (damage_object). An object worn to nothing is turned into debris or removed
   (remove_object): a door opens and loses its locks, a chest or barrel spills, a bag
   drops its contents.

   UW1 against UW2: no debris_type (broken objects become one of the two piles of debris,
   0xD5 or 0xD6, at random), no broken weapons, no djinn bottle, no test of a chest's id bit
   13, no fire against cold doubling in check_res, debris is not given fresh hit points or
   quality, every object with id bit 13 set is indestructible (UW2 excepts doors), and
   damaging an owned object does not anger its owner.

   Data owned: none; the per-item table is ComObjData (object.h).
   Name: UW2Decomp's (damage_object is in System Shock's DAMAGE.C, the damage to objects in
   both). */
