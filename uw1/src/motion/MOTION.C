/* Motion: stepping a physics record through the tile grid, bouncing off walls, floors and
   objects. The whole of UW1's DOS resident segment seg030_2B26 (UW2's seg031_2CFA), in
   original order. UW1 has no symbol-bearing build: function and global names are UW2's
   (the FM Towns symbol table), the routines being the same; the source file's own name
   is not known.

   UW1 against UW2: no set_jmp; do_physics keeps its try count in a local; rehead has no
   diagonal-tile corner placement and, when the heading is unchanged, picks the corner at
   random; bounce_that_guy always turns and throws up at 0xEB; do_zbounce lands on water
   by bit 0 of the floor state alone, has no Bouncing-spell case, no ice terrain and no
   speed restore; get_pcoll's flags and several returns are signed chars. Callers and
   neighbours named below are UW2's.

   Everything that moves under physics comes through do_physics: the player (PN with the
   handler PT, from PLAYMOVE.C's move_player), walking, flying and swimming critters (CN1,
   CN2 and CN4 with CT1, CT2 and CT4, chosen in critter/AI.C) and thrown or falling objects
   and missiles (CN3 with CT3, critter/PATHFIND.C's move_me_joe). The caller fills a struct
   Phys (motion.h) with a position in 1/256 tiles (z in 1/8 of an object's z unit), a
   heading and speed, a vertical velocity and gravity (acc[2]) and the ticks to run (time),
   and do_physics advances it in place.

   How a move works: space_to_motion turns heading and speed into a velocity and sets up a
   Bresenham walk along the larger of the x and y velocities (struct MotionParams MP), one
   1/8-tile cell per step, with the minor axis and z carried as fractions (0x2000 to a cell
   in x and y, 0x800 in z). grid_move takes one step (flat_move, or full_move when there is
   vertical velocity). After each step check_positions asks COLLIDE.C what the mover now
   overlaps (get_pcoll: floor, walls, slopes and objects, as a word of state bits) and
   reacts: it steps back, stops, calls the handler's special function, bounces off a wall
   (do_2dbounce and rehead) or starts a fall. Reaching the target height in z (a floor, a
   ceiling or the top of an object, chosen by set_targz) goes to do_zbounce. back_to_space
   writes the cell position back into the record.

   The collision state bits (get_pcoll's result, built from struct MotionCalc's hits0 and
   hits1, which COLLIDE.C fills): bits 0-1 the floor's terrain class (0 plain, 1 water,
   2 lava, 3 ice; map.h TERRAIN_*), 4 standing on the floor, 8 << class a footprint corner
   on a floor of that class, 0x80 standing on a solid object, 0x100 a floor higher than
   the mover can step, 0x200 a wall, 0x400 an object in the way, 0x800 a drop below,
   0x1000 nothing underneath (falling), 0x2000 on a slope, 0x4000 and 0x8000 an object
   hit that stops the mover or ends this move (do_objhit's 0x10 and 8). These meanings are
   read from COLLIDE.C's SolvePnt and SolveCenter and from the code here; nothing names
   them.

   The terrain byte CP->terrain (set_resterr) has one bit per kind of footing: 1 plain
   floor, 2 water, 4 lava, 8 ice, 0x10 in the air, and 0x20 for the player standing on
   water with a corner of the footprint on another floor (probably the shore; the player
   code treats it like water). res_to_terr turns it back into the 0-4 code an object
   stores (OBJ_TERRAIN).

   Neighbours: COLLIDE.C (seg028: TerrainCheck, ObjectCheck, process_objlist and the
   oCollisions list behind Ppd's fields), OBJPHYS.C (seg030: do_objhit, and get_phys_data
   and set_phys_data, which convert an object to and from a struct Phys), PHYSICS.C and
   PLAYMOVE.C (the player), critter/AI.C and PATHFIND.C (critters and objects).
