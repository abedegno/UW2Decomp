/* The player's physics: the terrain the player stands in, the simple step-and-turn
   movement, the per-tick motion setup from the input, applying the result to the player
   object, and moving the player between tiles. The whole of DOS resident segment
   seg008_1B2A, in original order. Seeded from UW2Decomp's src/motion/PHYSICS.C (UW2's
   seg008_1B09). Function and global names are UW2's (the FM Towns originals) where the
   routine is the same one; UW1 has no symbols of its own.

   UW1 against UW2: no ice and no water currents (munge_vectors and their state are
   absent), no change_GrSq, hgt_change or player_newsq (the tile change is written out
   where UW2 calls change_GrSq, and there are no pressure plate or light checks), and
   three functions of its own at the end, before newFPS: BouncePlayer, DoTrapScreenShake
   and QuakeTrap (the listing's names), a quake trap's shake and throw. player_setup has
   no third argument, newFPS scales the speeds out of 10 with no swimming skill, and
   do_player_input has no paralysis test. struct Player is UW1's (player.h).

   The player's physics record is PN (motion.h, owned by MOTION.C) with the handler PT,
   whose special function is player_sqhandler. Each tick move_player calls
   set_player_phys_params (input into PN), MOTION.C's do_physics, and phys_affect_player
   (PN back into the player object, ThePlayer, and fall damage). simple_fizix is the
   other way to move: a fixed step or a 45 degree turn.

   The movement state (newFPS's state, the player's fps): 0 on foot, 1 swimming, 2 on
   lava, 3 (ice in UW2; nothing sets it here), and in the air 4 levitating, 5 flying, 6 slow falling. It sets
   the motion state's low bits and the speeds pFPS, scaled from Run_FPS, Side_FPS and
   Back_FPS. motionbits holds the motion spells: 1 leap (lower gravity when jumping),
   2 slow fall, 4 levitate, 8 water walk (no swimming), 0x10 fly.

   GrSq is the player's tile as an index into mapdata.

   name: UW2Decomp's (its map/filenames.tsv: the player's physics, simple_fizix and
   fizix_update; the job of System Shock's PHYSICS.C).

   Entry points: player_setup (UWEDIT.C's new_player_pos, SPELLS.C, MAINMENU.C);
   set_player_phys_params and phys_affect_player (PLAYMOVE.C's move_player); simple_fizix

   (PLAYDATA.C); QuakeTrap_seg008_DE7 (TRIGGER.C); EtherealVoidSpecialEffects_seg008_150
   (INTERACT.C). Data owned: GrSq, pTurn, pFPS and the speeds, lastTerr, motionbits,
