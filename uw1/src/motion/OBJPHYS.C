/* Object physics: bouncing, missile hits, collisions between objects, copying an object
   to and from the physics record, moving objects between the static and mobile lists,
   and settling a placed object into its tile. The whole of DOS resident segment
   seg029_29EE, in original order. Seeded from UW2Decomp's src/motion/OBJPHYS.C (UW2's
   seg030_2BB7): the same functions in the same order, less UW2's do_filanium. Function
   and global names are UW2's (the FM Towns originals); UW1 has no symbols of its own.

   An object in the map is either static (an 8-byte record, objdata and above, no motion
   state) or mobile (the longer records of critdata, below objdata: creatures and anything
   in motion). get_phys_data and set_phys_data convert between a mobile or static object
   and a struct Phys (motion.h) for MOTION.C's do_physics: critter/AI.C and PATHFIND.C
   call them around each critter's or moving object's step. When a moving object comes to
   rest set_phys_data turns it back into a static object (mob_to_static) and settles it
   with obj_deal; a static object given speed becomes mobile (static_to_mob, mob_init).
   The caller passes the object's tile in the globals XP and YP (critter.h).

   A mobile non-creature keeps its exact position in fields a creature uses for its AI:
   goal_word and attitude_word hold x and y in 1/256 tiles and b0F z in 1/8 units. A
   creature's or static object's position is only known to 1/8 tile, so get_phys_data
   fills the low bits at random.

   do_objhit is MOTION.C's response to touching an object: it uses usable objects and
   triggers (UseObj, UseTrigger), lets a missile strike (UseObj calls missile_newhit for a
   missile used on what it hit), and pushes the other object (bounce_obj). obj_deal
   settles an object dropped or placed in a tile: it destroys it in a wall, in another
   object or in water, may burn it in lava, and sets it moving if it lands on nothing.

   UW1 differences, all from the bytes: no satellites (missile_newhit) and no fireball or
   sphere exception in do_objhit, which marks creatures too and takes any major class 6
   object as a trigger; set_phys_data checks no pressure plates and no height change,
   damages on impacts over 0x100 without scaling by kind, stores the hit points twice and
   sets gravity only for acc -4; mob_to_static and obj_deal make no filanium check, obj_deal
   no splash and no ice case, and its random speed and pitch come after a bounce as well;
   mob_to_static keeps nothing on level 9, and on level 8 an object of fate 10 (talismans,
   by the listing's name) landing in lava within 6 tiles of the map's centre while the
   player lives is destroyed in an explosion, counting down player byte 0x6D (when bit 2
   of player word 0x62 allows it; otherwise it sets bit 3 of player word 0x6E). Some flags and returns are read as signed
   chars (cbw), marked where they are.

   name: descriptive, UW2Decomp's (its map/filenames.tsv: object physics, bounce_obj,
   static_to_mob). */
