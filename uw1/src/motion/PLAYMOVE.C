/* Player input and motion: the mouse and keyboard movement controls, the clock that
   drives player and object physics, head bob, footstep and swimming sounds, the noise
   the player makes, screen shake from water, lava and quakes, and placing the 3D camera.
   The whole of UW1's DOS resident segment seg034_2F89 (UW2's seg035_31AB), in original
   order. UW1 has no symbol-bearing build: function and global names are UW2's (the FM
   Towns symbol table), the routines being the same, except where a comment says the name
   is ours or the listing's; the source file's own name is not known. Callers and other
   files named here are UW2's.

   UW1 against UW2: the player record is laid out differently (struct Player, player.h);
   parse_playin and move_physics do not look at the Wizard Eye; make_noise has no swimming strokes and plain floor
   footsteps only (sounds 1 and 2); parse_effect has no early exit when motion_state is 0,
   no djinn step, spares a player wearing the dragon skin boots from lava, and has no
   sliding shake (slidEfflen and effect 0x80 do not exist); nextstep, water_eff and
   watertime are this file's data.

   The clock: the 3D view's change handlers call check_physics every frame (game/UWEDIT.C
   keeps it running through change_state). It measures the time since the last call on
   the tick counter *Time (at most 0x40), adds it to the game clock and calls
   move_physics, which moves the player (move_player: PHYSICS.C's
   set_player_phys_params, MOTION.C's do_physics, PHYSICS.C's phys_affect_player), moves
   the critters and objects (critter/AI.C's move_mobile, by frames of 16 time units,
   halved under Haste), and does the screen effects and sounds. player_simple_move, the
   step keys, runs the same round for one fixed step.

   Input: PlayerInput is the movement command (PHYSICS.C's do_player_input has the list),
   set by parse_playin from the mouse in the view or the key bindings, and by
   do_player_keyboard from the keys held down (key_on). ForwInpRate and TurnInpRate are
   how fast to go forward and turn, from the mouse's position or fixed for the keys.

   Effects: playerMod[0..3] are offsets to the camera's height, heading, pitch and bank
   (get_eye adds them when doMod is set): head bob while walking, the swimmer's bob and
   roll, the jump crouch, the slow float while levitating or flying (motion_state 8),
   and two timed shakes started by set_effect (0x20 combEfflen, 0x40 tremEfflen, bits of
   the player record's motion_state). The camera position itself
   is get_eye's.

   name: descriptive (map/filenames.tsv: player input and motion, player_mous_move,
   move_player). */
