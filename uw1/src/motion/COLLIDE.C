/* Terrain and object collision for anything that moves or is placed: the floor height
   under the four corners of a mover's footprint, the walls between them, the objects
   it overlaps sorted by height, and the placing of objects in the map. The whole of DOS
   resident segment seg026, in original order. Seeded from UW2Decomp's
   src/motion/COLLIDE.C (UW2's seg028_2941): the same functions in the same order, less
   UW2's get_home_tile, which UW1 does not have. Function and global names are UW2's
   (the FM Towns originals); UW1 has no symbols of its own.

   UW1 differences, all from the bytes: GetHgt's steep flag, SolvePnt's result and the
   useflag, flier and Obj_Elem_Fate tests are signed chars (cbw), and a tile's terrain
   word takes the floor texture's whole terrain byte shifted left 4 (UW2 masks 0xC0 and
   shifts 2).

   All of it works on the collision record curP points at (struct MotionCalc, map.h):
   the caller sets x, y, z (1/8 tiles, z in object units), radius, height and the
   object's index, and the checks fill hits0, hits1, floor, top, slope, open, found,
   count and first. MOTION.C points curP at Ppd; can_place, obj_deal (OBJPHYS.C) and the
   player and critter code use a local record and restore curP.

   TerrainCheck looks at the 3x3 tiles around the centre (tiles[], one terrain word each:
   type, height and floor terrain class, read lazily) and at five points: the centre and
   the four corners of the square footprint radius wide. GetHgt gives the floor height at
   a point (0x80 for a wall, or the solid half of a diagonal; slopes rise one unit per
   cell). SolveCenter and SolvePnt turn each height into state bits against z and the
   step range (MOTION.C's header lists them): wall, too high, a drop, or on a floor of a
   given terrain class. A corner in another tile that a diagonal wall blocks (tile_walls)
   is a wall too. ComputeHeading then sums the corners into the direction of the blocking
   walls (slope) and of the open side (open), which MOTION.C's do_2dbounce uses.

   ObjectCheck finds the objects whose square overlaps the footprint, in the tiles around
   (at most 8, oCollisions), and process_objlist sorts them: those whose top is at or
   below z first (bottom of the list, by top), then those overlapping the mover's height
   (first and count), by bottom.

   can_place, put_at, near_mob_put_at and drop_around_place place objects: they are used
   all over the game to drop, create and move things, and drop_around_place tries up to
   24 random spots within range.

   File names mentioned (MOTION.C, OBJPHYS.C) are UW2Decomp's.
   name: descriptive, UW2Decomp's (its map/filenames.tsv: terrain and object collision,
