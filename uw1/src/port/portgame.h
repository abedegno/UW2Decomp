/* portgame.h: UW1's side of Exhume's runtime (Exhume's docs/port.md, "The runtime"; its
   runtime/README.md, "The project's side"). The runtime's port.h, compat.h, plat.h and its sound
   and system C include it, ahead of their own defaults; compat.h brings it into the game's C too,
   so it declares only the port's names.

   The program's name in its messages, and the game's main it runs; DGROUP's paragraph in UW.EXE,
   which the pseudo-registers _DS and _SS start with, and where Borland's _ctype table sits in
   DGROUP (DS:1E00, after the C library's ATEXIT word at 1DFE: build/LINK/out/UW.MAP, and the
   bytes); the termination chain exit runs, which seg019's init hooked; the black box; the
   window; how the game's folder is found and what the settings file is called; the sound
   library's environment variables; and the far data blocks of UW.EXE that no source defines
   yet (mem/fardata.c), whose initial bytes are read from the user's own UW.EXE at start-up,
   never shipped. The load segment is the runtime's default; the far heap starts where DOS's
   does (PORT_HEAP_FIRST, below). */
