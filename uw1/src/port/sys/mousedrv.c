/* mousedrv.c: replaces src/sys/MOUSEDRV.ASM (seg019 module 10) and the DOS mouse driver under
   it (int 33h). The driver's state is built from the platform layer's pointer events: the
   position, in the driver's 640 by 200 range for mode 13h, the buttons, and the motion counters
   in mickeys, at the driver's default of 8 mickeys per 8 pixels across and 16 per 8 down, so a
   pointer moving one screen pixel gives two mickeys either way. The game reads only the motion
   and the buttons (MOUSE.C keeps its own cursor), so a touch screen drives it as a mouse does.

   The game's cursor follows the host's pointer. Fed the host's motion, it drifts away from
   it: the scaling drops half a pixel whenever the mickeys are odd, and the game stops its
   cursor at the edges of the box it confines it to while the host's pointer goes on. So
   while the pointer is not captured (an event with absolute set), function 0Bh reports
   the motion that puts the game's cursor (mouse_getxy) where the host's pointer is, once per
   move of the host's pointer, and none while it stays still, which leaves the game's own
   moves (the keyboard's warps, mouse_putxy) alone. Captured (the pointer lock option,
   platform/sdl3), the host's motion goes through as mickeys, in whole pixels so that none
   is lost to the scaling.

   MOUSEDRV.ASM's routines are kept: _6C8 resets the driver and stores the motion divisor (200)
   in FD72:0360 and MouseOn (FD72:0362); _6E7 reads the motion and scales it by 100 / 200;
   _703 gives the buttons. */
