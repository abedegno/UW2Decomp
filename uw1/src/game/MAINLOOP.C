/* The main loop and the per-screen change dispatcher.
   mainloop runs until notdone is cleared: each pass runs do_changes when any change bit
   is set, then hands the input list (inplist) to input_dispatch, which reads the mouse
   and keyboard and calls the handlers of the current screen. do_changes is how the game
   redraws: anything that needs work on the next pass sets a bit in the global changed
   with editchng, and do_changes calls editor_dispatch[scrnum][bit] for each set bit
   (15 bits, 0 to 14), clearing the bit first. scrnum picks one screen's table (in UW2
   UWEDIT.C owns editor_dispatch, change_state and scrnum). change_state[scrnum] is or-ed
   back in after every pass, so a screen can keep some bits always set. It also counts
   down pmouseHandled to give the mouse back with mouse_freereign.
   UW1 differences from UW2's MAINLOOP.C: mainloop tests changed itself before calling
   do_changes, and there is no digital sound effect playback (no dsfx_playing, no call
   to update_digi_playback), so this file has no _DATA.
   Entry points: mainloop, editchng (called all over the game), do_changes.
   The whole of UW1's DOS resident segment seg011_1CA3, in original order.
   Name: inferred (mainloop is its first function, and System Shock's main loop file is
   MAINLOOP.C). UW1 has no symbol-bearing build: the function names are UW2's, from the
   FM Towns symbol table, the routines being the same. */
