/* target: seg028_2985 */
/* opts: -mm -1 -G -O -Y -d */
/* The player's timed updates: active spells running down, light sources burning out,
   poison, hunger, drunkenness and drowning. The whole of DOS resident segment
   seg028_2985, in original order. Seeded from UW2Decomp's src/game/PLAYTIME.C (UW2's
   overlay ovr135). Function names are UW2's (the FM Towns originals), the routines being
   the same; UW1 has no symbols of its own.

   The clock: duration_check runs once per tick of the player's slow clock (UW2's caller is
   INTERACT.C). plyregen[1] counts the calls, and the work is spread over that count:
     every call     active spells lose a step, lights burn, mushrooms wear off,
                    regeneration, drowning;
     every 3rd      poison damage, and a mana regeneration roll on the mana skill;
     every 24th     hunger, sobering up, a 1 in 4 chance of wandering monsters, the
                    critters' yearly_checkup, fatigue and two neighbouring bytes counted
                    up, an HP regeneration roll on strength (inferred: attr[ATTR_STR]), and the
                    count starts again.
   Entry points: duration_check, set_curmagic (the spells, to start an active spell),
   DegradeLights (also called with a larger amount when time passes quickly, probably by
   sleeping), sink_sink_sink, dispel_spell.

   UW1 against UW2: no Killorn countdown, sleep counter or hourly schedule (UW2's every 60th
   call); the slow work is every 24th call (UW2 30th); lights burn while time is stopped,
   go out at quality 0 and ValidLightSlots is signed; drowning flashes colour 0xC6.
   struct Player differs (Player1Time below).
   Data: none of its own; plyregen and the light tables are elsewhere.
   Name: descriptive (the player's timed updates: duration_check, DegradeLights). */
