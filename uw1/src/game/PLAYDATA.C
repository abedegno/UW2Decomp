/* The player record's load and save, and everything that is worked out again from the
   player's equipment and active spells: the whole of UW1's DOS overlay ovr133, in
   original order. Seeded from UW2Decomp's src/game/PLAYDATA.C (UW2's ovr142).
   save_player_data and read_player_data (called from INVSAVE.C, inside a save or a
   restore) write and read the player record as the PLAYER.DAT image: one key byte,
   name[0] xor 0xAA, then the 0xD2-byte record xor-encoded with that key (xorwrite,
   xorread). Before writing, the values that live elsewhere while playing (attributes, HP,
   the player's position, heading and level, sound and music, terrain) are copied into
   the record; after reading they are copied back out.
   FixPlayerEquips is called whenever equipment, spells or light change: it recomputes
   armour by hit location, defence, the weapon's animation, the brightest carried light,
   the effects of active spells and of enchanted worn items (player_affected_by),
   stealth (plyNotice), the light level and the mushroom effect.

   UW1 against UW2: the record is 0xD2 bytes with its own layout (Player1Data below); no
   DL.DAT (load_dl) and no per-level minimum light, no poison weapon or valor; two
   functions of UW1's own, swap_tmap (a body here, empty in UW2) and set_maze, the maze
   navigation spell (class 13 minor 4) that swaps the floor textures for the maze level,
   level 7; FixPlayerEquips notes worn dragon skin boots, and does not test the void's
   sleep.

   Data owned: player, playerdat, ThePlayer, PlayerLevel, PlayerFacing, PlayerHeading,
   player_name_handle, plyNotice, UsingPole, the dragon skin boots and maze flags, and the
   tables below.
   UW1 has no symbol-bearing build: names are UW2's (the FM Towns symbol table) where the
   routine is the same.
   Name: descriptive (reading and writing player data and its spells, save_player_data). */
