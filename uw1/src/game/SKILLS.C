/* Skills, levelling, mantras, end-game statistics, sleep and dreams, eating, the silver
   tree, death and traps: the whole of UW1's DOS overlay ovr143, in original order.
   Seeded from UW2Decomp's src/game/SKILLS.C (UW2's ovr154).

   Skills: the player record's skills[], 0 to 30 each, each governed by an attribute
   (prime). add_to_skill is character creation's raise, get_skill a trainer's or a skill
   point's raise. player_compute derives maximum HP, mana and carrying weight; advance
   gains levels. mantra_advance is chanting at a shrine: a skill's own mantra raises that
   skill twice over, the three group mantras raise skills of a group (great_advance and
   report_advance print the outcome), and three special mantras give the cup of wonder's
   whereabouts, the key of truth and a message.
   Sleep: player_sleep passes time, heals, feeds and sobers the player, and may show one
   of Garamon's dreams (dream).
   Death: player_is_dead returns the player to life at the silver tree if one was planted
   (plant_seed, do_resurrect), otherwise ends the game (UWEDIT.C's real_death).
   The end: check_victory, run every frame, shows the end screens once the game is won
   (EndGameMode_dseg_1C8F), and once every talisman is destroyed opens the moongate that
   takes the Slasher of Veils and the player to the void.
   Traps on objects: DetectedTrap and RemoveTrap.

   UW1 against UW2: no grant_skill_advance, cs_check, player_won_game, do_gem,
   do_dreamret, punt_mouse_obj, punt_void or go_void (no ethereal void dream, no
   blackrock gem); new mantra_advance, great_advance, report_advance, check_victory,
   plant_seed and do_resurrect. The player record differs (Player1Skills below).
   Data: skill_rng, EndGameMode_dseg_1C8F.
   UW1 has no symbol-bearing build: names are UW2's (the FM Towns symbol table) where the
   routine is the same; the new functions' names are descriptive, chosen so that their
   bssorder keys reproduce the EXE's overlay stub order (see each).
   Name: descriptive (skills, sleep, dreams, eating, death: use_skill, player_sleep). */
