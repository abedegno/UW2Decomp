/* Damage to objects that are not critters: resistances, wear on doors, containers and
   weapons, and what an object leaves behind when it breaks. The whole of DOS resident
   segment seg025_26A1, in original order.

   What it does in the game: every source of damage (melee in COMBAT.C, spells in SPELLS.C
   and SPELLS2.C, falls and collisions in the motion code, traps and world events in
   WORLDEV.C, eating and the void in SKILLS.C) calls damage_item. It applies the item's
   resistances from ComObjData (check_res), hands critters to damage_critter (AI.C), and
   for anything else takes the damage off the object's hit points or quality
   (damage_object). An object worn to nothing is turned into debris or removed
   (remove_object): a door opens and loses its locks, a chest or barrel spills, a weapon
   becomes the broken weapon of its skill, a bag drops its contents.

   Data owned: none; the per-item tables are ComObjData (object.h) and Weapons (combat.h).
   Function and global names are the originals from the FM Towns symbol table.
   Name: original (damage_object is in System Shock's DAMAGE.C, the damage to objects in both). */
